# Double-Pendulum-using-Lagrangian-Mechanics
I developed a double pendulum simulation using Lagrangian mechanics to derive coupled non-linear ODEs. With RK45 integration, it tracks four pendulums with nearly identical initial conditions. Even tiny differences (10⁻⁵ rad) cause trajectories to rapidly diverge, showcasing deterministic chaos.
